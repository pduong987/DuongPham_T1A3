### 									            Features use in the Bank Smart app:



| Type                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Login In/ Log Out  | The Ruby terminal app is more straightforward than the modern world, with a lot of security checking to Log In and Out of the bank in real life.  This Bank Smart app will provide a simple User log-ins with some data created already inside a hash that wait to be called out. The user needs to enter their name to Log In to the bank app to check their account balance. Therefore they can do other functions such as deposits or withdrawing their money, transferring between bank account or checking popular entertainment places that link to the Bank Smart app. |
| 2. Deposite/ Withdraw | The Bank Smart app allows them to draw money from their account. Each account has a current balance which will decrease every time withdrawal happen. At the same time, the account balance will increase if the User puts money in the Deposit account. |
| 3. Transfer           | As users' details are already set up, the User can transfer money between the bank account and the bank balance. Bank balance will be changed as money has been moving around between all those banks. Therefore, the amount balance in each bank account also increases or decreases depending on what action the User makes. |
| 4. Mortgage           | User will be asked for some personal detail of how much they earn in a year, expenses each month, and how much the house they want to buy with the mortgage option. The mortgage calculator which got desire in the app will do the calculation at the back end to see if the User can have a mortgage. The Bank Smart app would give them some details to book in a meeting with a proper banker to get a mortgage if they qualified to do so. Other than that, the Bank app will let them know that they can not get a mortgage and move to another function if they want to. |
| 5. Entertainment      | of the country. It is safer to have a holiday in Australia or visit some famous places at the weekend with family and friends. An entertainment option got created. It will link to a Website API to provide people with popular areas this week or months that people should come and visit. User can visit those places through the bank app to get a reservation and pay straight from the bank. If the User doesn't want to see or look through those website options, the bank app can lead them back to the bank option again or log out if the User wants. |
